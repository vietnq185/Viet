<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>HOW A-SMARTLEARNING USES AND PROCESSES THE INFORMATION
THAT YOU PROVIDE OR MAKE AVAILABLE</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We use, store and process Information about you for the
following general purposes:&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>to enable you to access and use the Site;</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>to operate, protect, improve and optimize the Site, A-SMARTLEARNING's
     business, and our users' experience, such as to perform analytics, conduct
     research, personalize or otherwise customize your experience, and for advertising
     and marketing;<br>
     <br>
 </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>to help create and maintain a trusted and safer
     environment on the Site and throughout the course of the Services; </li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>to send you service, support and administrative messages,
     reminders, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and information
     requested by you;</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=5 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>where we have your consent, to send you marketing and
     promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you,
     including information about A-SMARTLEARNING or general promotions for
     partner campaigns and services. You can unsubscribe or opt-out from
     receiving these communications in your settings (in the
     &quot;Account&quot; section) when you login to your A-SMARTLEARNING Account;
     and<br>

</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>HOW A-SMARTLEARNING USES AND PROCESSES USER
COMMUNICATIONS</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may, either directly or through third party companies and
individuals we engage to provide services to us, review, scan, or analyze your
communications with other users exchanged via the Site for fraud prevention,
risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development,
research and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud
prevention efforts, the Site may scan and analyze messages to mask contact
information and references to other websites. This helps to prevent fraudulent
actors from asking Clients to send them money outside of the Site, such as by
bank transfer or other money transfer methods. We may also scan, review or
analyze messages for research and product development purposes to help make
search, booking and user communications more efficient and effective, as well
as to debug, improve and expand product offerings.&nbsp;We will not review,
scan, or analyze your communications for sending third party marketing messages
to you. We will also not sell these reviews or analyses of communications to
third parties. We will also use automated methods to carry out these reviews or
analyses where reasonably possible. However, from time to time we may have to
manually review some communications. By using the Site, you consent that A-SMARTLEARNING,
in its sole discretion, may, either directly or through third party companies
and individuals we engage to provide services to us, review, scan, analyze, and
store your communications, whether done manually or through automated means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>COOKIE POLICY</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A-SMARTLEARNING uses &quot;cookies&quot; in conjunction with
the Site to obtain information. A cookie is a small data file that is
transferred to your device (e.g., your phone or your computer) for
record-keeping purposes. For example, a cookie could allow the Site to
recognize your browser, while another could store your preferences and other
information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your browser may allow you to set how it handles cookies,
such as declining all cookies or prompting you to decide whether to accept each
cookie. But please note that some parts of the Site may not work as intended or
may not work at all without cookies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A-SMARTLEARNING cookies and third party cookies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A-SMARTLEARNING may place our cookies on your device via the
Site. Accordingly, our Privacy Policy will apply to our treatment of the
information we obtain via our cookies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may also allow our business partners to place cookies on
your device. For example, we use Google Analytics for web analytics, and so
Google may also set cookies on your device. As further explained below, third
parties may also place cookies on your device for advertising purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two types of cookies used on the Site, namely
&quot;<b>persistent cookies</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>session cookies</b>&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Session cookies will normally expire when you close your
browser, while persistent cookies will remain on your device after you close
your browser, and can be used again the next time you access the Site.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Other technologies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Site may also use other technologies with similar
functionality to cookies, such as web beacons and tracking URLs to obtain Log
Data about users. We may also use web beacons and tracking URLs in our messages
to you to determine whether you have opened a certain message or accessed a
certain link.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Uses for A-SMARTLEARNING cookies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A-SMARTLEARNING uses cookies for a number of purposes, such
as the following:&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>to enable, facilitate and streamline the functioning of
     the Site across different webpages and browser sessions.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>to simplify your access to and use of the Site and make it
     more seamless.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>to monitor and analyze the performance, operation and
     effectiveness of the Site, so that we can improve and optimize it.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>to show you content (which may include advertisements)
     that is more relevant to you.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Uses for third party cookies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our partners' cookies are intended to obtain information to
help them provide services to A-SMARTLEARNING. For example, third party
companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us may track your
behavior on our Site to market and advertise A-SMARTLEARNING listings or
services to you on the Site and third party websites. Third parties that use
cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements on
our Site and/or third party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted
advertisements by opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the
Network Advertising Initiative (<a
href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>)
and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (<a
href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>).
You may also be able to control advertising cookies provided by publishers, for
example Google's Ad Preference Manager (<a
href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>).
Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted
advertising, you may still receive advertising on the Site � it just will not
be tailored to your interests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, Facebook places a cookie via the Site that
allows Facebook to obtain aggregated, non-Personal Information to optimize
their services. For example, if a user clicks on an advertisement for the A-SMARTLEARNING
mobile app on Facebook and subsequently installs the app, this cookie will
inform Facebook that a user (who is not personally identified) has installed
the app after clicking on the advertisement. This cookie may also inform
Facebook that a user is using the app, without identifying the specific actions
taken by the user in the app.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Disabling Cookies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can
modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of
your browser's toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you
may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features
of the Site. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie
management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To
learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website (<a
href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/</a>) and
make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel (<a
